                                    <p><b>A) You provide information.</b> When you freely disclose personal information to us through a number of features on the MyTurf, we may collect it. For example, when you register, utilise, pay to use, or subscribe to any of our application Services, or participate in any of the application Services' interactive features. We obtain a range of personal information from you directly or when you give us permission to access certain personal information.</p>
                                    <p>This contains your profile photo, phone number, and email address. By providing this information, you consent to our processing of that information, which you may cancel at any time.</p>
                                    <p><b>Phone number (optional)</b> - We needed a phone number to verify that the person was authentic. The user can also log in using their Apple ID or email address. For your safety, your phone number will not be displayed to other users.</p>
                                    <p><b>Profile photo</b> - Photo on your profile, allowing the user to be identified quickly. At the very least, the user agrees to supply a clean photo of his or her face. The use of the Services is contingent on both of these criteria being met. We're looking for a photo that shows a man or woman's face and isn't nudist.</p>
                                    <p><b>B) Furthermore,</b> while you use the MyTurf Services, you may be prompted to provide or send personal information to us, such as sending us comments via email. Our primary goal in collecting personal data from you is to provide you with a secure, seamless, efficient, and personalised experience. This enables us to offer services and features that are most likely to match your needs, as well as to tailor our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we believe is required to accomplish this goal. You are no longer anonymous to us once you have registered, and you can examine and alter certain personal information under the Edit Profile settings section.</p>
                                    <p><b>C) Geolocation Data.</b>  We'll utilise your location to figure out how far away you are from other users. Our servers keep your most recent known location in order to calculate distance information between you and other Users. While the MyTurf Service is active, we will also collect the geographic location data from your mobile device.</p>

                                    <p>We want you to have complete control over your data, therefore we've equipped you with the following tools:</p>
                                    <p><b>Access and update the service's tools.</b> Tools and account settings that allow you to directly within the service access, correct, or remove information that you gave to us and that is linked with your account. Please contact our customer service staff for assistance if you have any questions about those tools and setting</p>
                                    <p><b>Device permissions.</b> Permission systems exist for specific types of device data and notifications, such as location services and push notifications, on mobile platforms. You can adjust your device's settings to allow or disallow the collection of the associated data or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, you risk losing complete functioning of several services if you do so.</p>
                                    <p><b>Deletion.</b> You can delete your account directly on the service by utilising the appropriate feature.</p>
                                    <p>We want you to understand your privacy options. Here are some crucial considerations to keep in mind:</p>
                                    <p><b>Reviewing your information.</b> You may have the right under applicable privacy laws to inspect the personal information we keep on you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms). By sending us an email, you can request a copy of your personal information.</p>
                                    <p><b>Updating your information.</b> Please contact us here if you believe the information we possess on you is inaccurate or that we are no longer authorised to use it, and you wish to request its rectification, erasure, or objection to its processing.</p>
                                    <p>Before we can respond to the aforementioned requests, we may ask you to produce evidence of identity for your protection and the protection of all of our users.</p>
                                    <p>Keep in mind that we reserve the right to refuse requests for a variety of reasons, including if they are unlawful, infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property, or violate another user's privacy. If you want to receive information on another user, such as a copy of any messages you exchanged with him or her through our service, the other user must contact our Privacy Officer and provide written approval before the information is released.</p>
                                    <p>Furthermore, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal data, particularly if doing so would prevent us from providing our service to you. For example, if we don't have your date of birth, we won't be able to give our service.</p>
                                    <p><b>Uninstall.</b> You can stop an app from collecting data by deleting it using your device's usual uninstall method. The unique identification connected with your device will be preserved even if you remove the programme from your mobile device. We will be able to re-associate this identifier with your prior transactions and activity if you re-install the application on the same mobile device.</p>
